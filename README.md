Zipper is a command-line interface (CLI) application that allows you to embed multiple files into an image by creating a ZIP archive and appending it to the image. This can be useful for various purposes, such as hiding data within images or packaging files together with an image.


## Usage

Run the zipper application with the following syntax:
```
zipper.exe original.png output.png file.zip ...
```
Note: The application can append any ZIP-compatible file type, including `.zip`, `.7z`, `.rar`, and others.
